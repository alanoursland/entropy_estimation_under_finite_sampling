# Entropy Estimation: Foundations, Modern Applications, and Future Directions

## Foundations of Entropy Estimation in Finite Samples

**Bias of Sample Entropy and the Miller–Madow Correction:** Estimating Shannon entropy from finite samples (e.g. using a histogram or empirical distribution) is known to be a biased procedure. The naive “plug-in” estimator (using observed frequencies) tends to *underestimate* the true entropy, especially when sample size is small relative to the support size ([To BEE or Not to BEE: Estimating more than Entropy with Biased Entropy Estimators](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11395v1#:~:text=the%20inherent%20systematic%20error%20of,Notable%20advancements%20include)) ([A Note on Entropy Estimation | Neural Computation - MIT Press Direct](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/27/10/2097/8087/A-Note-on-Entropy-Estimation#:~:text=leads%20to%20a%20systematic%20underestimation,Bias%20analysis%20in%20entropy%20estimation)).  Early works by Miller (1955) and others quantified this bias and introduced corrections. In particular, Miller derived an asymptotic bias formula: \(E[\hat{H}] - H \approx -\frac{K-1}{2N}\), where \(K\) is the number of categories (bins) and \(N\) the sample size ([](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~binyu/ps/entropy.sub.pdf#:~:text=normal%20with%20variance%20equal%20to,EH%CB%86%20%E2%88%92%20H%20%3D%20%E2%88%92)) ([(PDF) Entropy Estimation in Turing's Perspective - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221797102_Entropy_Estimation_in_Turing's_Perspective#:~:text=ResearchGate%20www,H%E2%88%92H%29%20%3D%20%E2%88%92K%E2%88%921)).  This led to the **Miller–Madow correction**, which adjusts the empirical entropy upward by \((K-1)/(2N)\) to reduce bias ([](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~binyu/ps/entropy.sub.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Miller,estimating%20m%20by%20the%20number)). Miller’s short 1955 paper is considered the first bias-corrected entropy estimator ([To BEE or Not to BEE: Estimating more than Entropy with Biased Entropy Estimators](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11395v1#:~:text=the%20inherent%20systematic%20error%20of,Notable%20advancements%20include)), and later work by Basharin (1959) and others extended the analysis. These corrections are valid in the regime of large $N$ relative to $K$, and they substantially improve entropy estimates when data are sparse ([To BEE or Not to BEE: Estimating more than Entropy with Biased Entropy Estimators](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11395v1#:~:text=the%20inherent%20systematic%20error%20of,Notable%20advancements%20include)) ([](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~binyu/ps/entropy.sub.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Miller,estimating%20m%20by%20the%20number)). However, they are still asymptotic and can fail when sample size $N$ is on the same order as $K$ (the “undersampled” regime) ([[PDF] Estimation of Entropy and Mutual Information](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/pub/lcv/paninski-infoEst-2003.pdf#:~:text=This%20leads%20exactly%20to%20a,as%20discussed%20above%2C%20the)). This undersampling problem has motivated many subsequent estimators (jackknife, Bayesian methods, etc.) to further reduce bias beyond Miller–Madow ([To BEE or Not to BEE: Estimating more than Entropy with Biased Entropy Estimators](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11395v1#:~:text=the%20inherent%20systematic%20error%20of,Notable%20advancements%20include)).

**Variance of Entropy Estimates:** In addition to bias, the estimator’s variance is a crucial part of understanding entropy under finite sampling. Classic results give formulas for the *expected* entropy and its variance in the multinomial setting. Basharin (1959) derived a first-order approximation of the variance of the sample entropy ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=Basharin%20%281959%29%20obtained%20the%20first,ln2%20p%20j%20%E2%88%92%20H2)). To first order in large $N$, $\mathrm{Var}[\hat{H}] \approx \frac{1}{N}\left(\sum_{j} p_j (\ln p_j)^2 - H^2\right)$, which depends on the true distribution $p_j$ of outcomes ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=Basharin%20%281959%29%20obtained%20the%20first,ln2%20p%20j%20%E2%88%92%20H2)). This indicates the variance shrinks as $1/N$ for large samples. Harris (1975) later provided higher-order corrections, giving an expansion of the entropy variance up to $O(N^{-3})$ terms ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=1%20Harris%20,123)). In other words, Harris’s work refined how the variance decreases with sample size and distribution shape. These results, combined with asymptotic normality proofs ([[PDF] asymptotic normality of entropy estimators](https://math.charlotte.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/909/2024/05/2013_03.pdf#:~:text=,pk%2Cn%3Bk%20%3D%201%2C2)), mean that for large $N$, $\hat{H}$ is approximately normal with variance given by the formulas above. In practice, however, exact variance is “elusive” for finite samples ([[2105.12829] Estimating the variance of Shannon entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12829#:~:text=purpose%2C%20possibly%20the%20most%20widespread,The%20results)). Recent research has revisited this topic – for example, Ricci *et al.* (2021) derive exact distributions maximizing entropy-estimate variance and propose estimators for the variance itself ([[2105.12829] Estimating the variance of Shannon entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12829#:~:text=purpose%2C%20possibly%20the%20most%20widespread,The%20results)). Knowing the variance or uncertainty of an entropy estimate is valuable for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests on entropy values, which historically received less attention than bias correction. Overall, the foundational literature (Miller, Basharin, Harris, etc.) established not only how to *correct* the expected entropy in finite samples, but also how to quantify its reliability (variance) in principle ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=Basharin%20%281959%29%20obtained%20the%20first,ln2%20p%20j%20%E2%88%92%20H2)) ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=1%20Harris%20,123)).

These works form the foundation for any entropy estimator used today.

## Modern Applications of Entropy Estimation in Machine Learning and AI

Entropy estimation has become a widely used tool across machine learning and AI, often as a means to quantify uncertainty, information gain, or randomness in models. Below we survey several active use cases:

### Uncertainty Quantification and Out-of-Distribution Detection 
In predictive modeling, entropy of a probability output is a natural measure of uncertainty. Modern deep learning methods use **predictive entropy** to assess confidence in predictions ([Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/7219-simple-and-scalable-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-ensembles.pdf#:~:text=predictive%20entropy%20as%20well%20as,classes%2C%20as%20the%20ensemble%20size)). For example, an image classifier’s softmax output entropy is high for uncertain or ambiguous inputs and low for confident ones. This is exploited in *out-of-distribution (OOD) detection*: models flag inputs as novel if the predicted entropy is abnormally high. Hendrycks & Gimpel (2017) popularized using the max softmax probability (inversely related to entropy) as a simple baseline for OOD detection ([Conditional Entropy Based Transferable Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/html/2204.11041v3#:~:text=Conditional%20Entropy%20Based%20Transferable%20Out,DNN%29)), and subsequent works have proposed improved entropy-based scores. One recent example is the **Generalized Entropy (GEN) score**, which is an entropy-derived metric applied post-hoc to any classifier’s softmax outputs ([GEN: Pushing the Limits of Softmax-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liu_GEN_Pushing_the_Limits_of_Softmax-Based_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf#:~:text=work%2C%20we%20propose%20Generalized%20ENtropy,Furthermore%2C%20we%20used)). Liu *et al.* (2023) showed this method significantly boosts OOD detection accuracy on ImageNet-based benchmarks ([GEN: Pushing the Limits of Softmax-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liu_GEN_Pushing_the_Limits_of_Softmax-Based_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf#:~:text=work%2C%20we%20propose%20Generalized%20ENtropy,Furthermore%2C%20we%20used)), outperforming earlier confidence scores. In Bayesian deep learning and ensemble models, entropy is also central: methods like Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan *et al.*, 2017) evaluate the entropy of the averaged predictive distribution to gauge uncertainty ([Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/7219-simple-and-scalable-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-ensembles.pdf#:~:text=should%20concentrate%20on%20the%20true,a)) ([Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/7219-simple-and-scalable-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-ensembles.pdf#:~:text=Figure%203%3A%20%3A%20Histogram%20of,10%20%5B31%5D%20test)). High predictive entropy correlates with inputs where different ensemble members disagree, indicating epistemic uncertainty. Such uncertainty measures are crucial in safety-critical domains (autonomous driving, medical diagnosis) where a model “knowing what it doesn’t know” is as important as its accuracy ([GEN: Pushing the Limits of Softmax-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liu_GEN_Pushing_the_Limits_of_Softmax-Based_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,networks%20to%20make%20over%02confident%20predictions)). Active learning algorithms likewise rely on entropy-based acquisition functions: a common strategy is to query labels for samples with the highest predictive entropy, on the assumption that these are the most informative unknowns ([NeurIPS_wappendix](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4f1fba885f266d87653900fd3045e8af-Paper-Conference.pdf#:~:text=most%20common%20acquisition%20function%20is,a%20new%20data%20point%20by)). In fact, using entropy as an acquisition function dates back at least to MacKay (1992) ([NeurIPS_wappendix](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4f1fba885f266d87653900fd3045e8af-Paper-Conference.pdf#:~:text=most%20common%20acquisition%20function%20is,a%20new%20data%20point%20by)) and remains a standard in deep active learning to choose uncertain samples for annotation. All these examples show entropy estimation has become a practical yardstick for model confidence and decision-making under uncertainty in modern AI systems.

### Probabilistic Modeling and Information-Theoretic Regularization 
Many machine learning methods explicitly incorporate entropy in their objective functions or evaluation metrics. In **probabilistic modeling** and **variational inference**, entropy terms arise naturally. For instance, the loss function in variational autoencoders includes the entropy of the approximate posterior over latent variables, which must be estimated (often in closed-form for tractable distributions) to optimize the evidence lower bound. In **reinforcement learning (RL)**, the concept of *maximum entropy* policies has gained traction. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm (Haarnoja *et al.*, 2018) is a prime example: it augments the reward objective with an entropy term, so the agent aims to maximize expected reward **while also maximizing the entropy of its policy** ([Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/haarnoja18b.html#:~:text=critic%2C%20an%20off,policy%20methods.%20Furthermore%2C%20we)). This encourages exploration and robustness, as the agent avoids prematurely collapsing to a deterministic policy. Maximizing entropy in RL has led to improved stability and performance on complex tasks ([Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/haarnoja18b.html#:~:text=critic%2C%20an%20off,policy%20algorithms%2C%20our%20approach%20is)). In semi-supervised learning, *entropy regularization* is used to improve generalization: Grandvalet & Bengio (2005) introduced **minimum entropy regularization**, adding a penalty so that the classifier’s output distribution on unlabeled data has low entropy (i.e. the model confidently self-labels) as a way to enforce decision boundaries in low-density regions ([Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618545_Semi-supervised_Learning_by_Entropy_Minimization#:~:text=Semi,in%20the%20standard%20supervised%20learning)). This idea has influenced modern semi-supervised techniques and consistency training. Entropy is also the basis of widely used evaluation metrics: the **cross-entropy loss** used to train classifiers is essentially the entropy of the true distribution plus the KL divergence between true and predicted – minimizing cross-entropy implicitly pushes the model to match distributions and thus get entropy-related calibration right. In language modeling, **perplexity** (a common metric) is directly $2^{H}$, an exponentiation of the entropy (cross-entropy) of the model on test text – lower perplexity means the model assigns higher probability (lower entropy) to the observed sequence. Overall, throughout probabilistic ML, Shannon entropy serves both as a **theoretical principle** (e.g. maximum entropy modeling for deriving probability distributions with constraints, such as MaxEnt classifiers in NLP) and a **practical term** to be estimated or optimized (in RL, VAEs, active learning, etc.). As these models often operate in high dimensions, recent research also explores new entropy estimators – e.g. a 2022 study proposed a Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE) using a neural network to consistently estimate joint entropy in high-dimensional data ([Entropy estimation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_estimation#:~:text=16.%20,3204919)), reflecting the need for modern tools to compute entropy within deep models.

### Feature Selection and Information Gain 
Entropy and its derivatives (like mutual information) are cornerstone criteria for **feature selection** and **decision tree learning**. In decision trees (e.g. CART, ID3/C4.5), the splitting criterion is based on **information gain**, which is the reduction in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute. This concept, introduced by Quinlan and others in the 1980s, prefers features that most reduce the uncertainty (entropy) of the class labels ([Information gain (decision tree) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_(decision_tree)#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20this%20concept,why)) ([Information gain (decision tree) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_(decision_tree)#:~:text=In%20general%20terms%2C%20the%20expected,takes%20some%20information%20as%20given)). Practically, computing information gain requires estimating entropies of label distributions in parent vs. child nodes (essentially entropy estimation on categorical data, corrected by counts). Similarly, filter-based feature selection methods in machine learning often rank features by **mutual information with the target variable**, which involves entropy estimation for the joint and marginal distributions of feature and target. For example, Battiti (1994) and Peng *et al.* (2005) introduced algorithms like MIFS and mRMR that select a subset of features maximizing relevance (mutual information with the class) and minimizing redundancy between features ([Frontiers | A Review of Feature Selection Methods for Machine Learning-Based Disease Risk Prediction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioinformatics/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.927312/full#:~:text=More%20advanced%20multivariate%20filter%20techniques%2C,Yu%20and%20Liu)). These methods rely on entropy estimates from empirical data (with bias corrections or plug-in estimates) to evaluate candidate feature subsets. The continued popularity of mutual information for feature selection is seen in many recent works and reviews ([Frontiers | A Review of Feature Selection Methods for Machine Learning-Based Disease Risk Prediction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioinformatics/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.927312/full#:~:text=More%20advanced%20multivariate%20filter%20techniques%2C,Yu%20and%20Liu)). Beyond feature ranking, entropy is used in clustering and image segmentation to find optimal partitions, and in reinforcement learning to estimate the “information gain” of exploring a state. In summary, entropy estimation enables quantifying the informational value of features or decisions in a model. It provides a language for algorithms to decide **which feature best reduces uncertainty** or **how much information is gained** by a split – concepts that are at the heart of explainable and efficient model design.

### Other Current Uses and Recent Advances
There are numerous other modern uses of entropy-based techniques. In **neural network interpretability**, researchers have started to use information-theoretic measures to explain model predictions. For instance, Gat *et al.* (2022) propose measuring the contribution of input features to the “functional entropy” of a network’s outputs as a way to gauge feature importance in deep models ([A Functional Information Perspective on Model Interpretation](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/gat22a.html#:~:text=Contemporary%20predictive%20models%20are%20hard,our%20method%20surpasses%20existing%20interpretability)). This approach, leveraging entropy and mutual information, is a recent attempt to bring information estimates into model interpretability research. In fields like **neuroscience and bioinformatics**, entropy estimates of probability distributions (spike trains, genomic sequences, etc.) are used to quantify variability or complexity. These often use improved estimators (like the Nemenman–Shafee–Bialek (NSB) Bayesian entropy estimator ([Entropy estimation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_estimation#:~:text=issue%208%2C%20April%202010%2C%20pp,1%5D%20In%20Przeglad%20Elektrotechniczny))) to handle undersampled regimes common in experimental data. Industry applications also abound: for example, **uncertainty quantification in deployed ML systems** (such as a medical imaging model) may use entropy of the predictive distribution to decide whether to defer a prediction to a human expert ([GEN: Pushing the Limits of Softmax-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liu_GEN_Pushing_the_Limits_of_Softmax-Based_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,networks%20to%20make%20over%02confident%20predictions)). Companies deploying NLP models track perplexity/entropy to monitor model drift. Even data augmentation and GAN research sometimes measure the entropy of generated samples’ distribution to assess mode collapse or diversity. These applications demonstrate that entropy estimation is not just a theoretical exercise – it is integral to many pipeline decisions and evaluations in modern ML.

## Gaps and Potential Future Directions

Despite its broad use, there are areas in ML and AI that have yet to fully exploit entropy estimation and especially *variance* quantification of entropy. We highlight a few opportunities:

- **Improved Calibration and Robustness via Entropy Variance:** Current neural networks often produce poorly calibrated probability estimates – their predicted entropy can be misleadingly low or high ([Calibrated Diverse Ensemble Entropy Minimization for Robust Test-Time Adaptation in Prostate Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12697v1#:~:text=the%20most%20common%20and%20promising,24)). While methods like deep ensembles yield better calibrated entropy estimates (by averaging out some uncertainties), single models do not quantify the *uncertainty of the entropy itself*. There is a gap in techniques for computing when a model’s predicted entropy is **statistically reliable** versus when it might itself have high variance due to limited data. Future research could incorporate the variance of entropy estimates (as derived by Basharin/Harris) to flag predictions where the entropy measure is not confident. This could enhance reliability in safety-critical systems: e.g. a self-driving car’s vision system might not only compute high entropy for an unfamiliar obstacle, but also know if that entropy estimate is based on sufficient sample evidence. Incorporating entropy variance into model calibration or confidence intervals for uncertainty measures is largely unexplored in deep learning.

- **Entropy-Based Interpretability and Explainable AI:** Entropy estimation could play a bigger role in model interpretability. Thus far, most explainable AI techniques focus on deterministic importance scores or gradients. Information-theoretic viewpoints (like the 2022 “functional entropy” approach ([A Functional Information Perspective on Model Interpretation](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/gat22a.html#:~:text=Contemporary%20predictive%20models%20are%20hard,our%20method%20surpasses%20existing%20interpretability))) remain rare. There is room to develop methods where internal activations’ entropy is tracked through layers to identify **where a network increases or reduces uncertainty** about the data. For example, one could measure the entropy of feature distributions at different layers for different classes – a sudden drop might indicate a decisive discriminatory layer, highlighting important features. Also, feature attribution methods might use *mutual information with the output* as a more principled importance metric rather than ad-hoc measures. Such techniques could improve interpretability by quantifying how much uncertainty each feature resolves in a prediction, but they are not yet standard practice.

- **Untapped Areas in Deep Learning:** Several subfields could benefit from entropy estimation but have not fully embraced it. One is **adversarial robustness** – currently, adversarial example detectors often look at confidence (probability) scores, but explicit entropy measures (and their variance) could help identify inputs where the model is overly confident (low entropy) in a wrong prediction. Research could explore if adversarial attacks can be detected by abnormal entropy patterns (though adversarial examples often produce confident outputs, so the key might be entropy at internal layers or for alternate models). Another area is **fairness and bias detection**: model decisions that are unfair might correspond to differences in entropy for certain subgroups (e.g. if a model is more uncertain for minority group inputs). Systematically estimating and comparing entropy across sub-populations could reveal hidden biases or brittleness, improving fairness analyses.

- **High-Dimensional and Structured Data:** As data complexity grows, new entropy estimators may be required. Deep generative models and multimodal models produce very high-dimensional probability outputs. Traditional histogram-based estimators are infeasible here. While techniques like the Neural Entropy Estimator ([Entropy estimation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_estimation#:~:text=16.%20,3204919)) are a start, more work is needed to estimate entropy for structured outputs (e.g. images, sequences) robustly. **Graph learning** could also gain from entropy measures – for example, entropy of node embedding distributions might indicate how well information is preserved, but this is not commonly measured. Developing entropy estimation for non-iid or dependent data (beyond the usual assumption of independent samples in a histogram) is an open research frontier.

- **Variance Quantification in Model Evaluation:** Beyond point estimates of metrics, giving *error bars* or ranges is important for robust ML. Entropy variance could enhance techniques like confidence scoring, model comparison, or hyperparameter tuning. For instance, when comparing two language models, one could test if the difference in their entropy (perplexity) is statistically significant given the variance of entropy estimates on the evaluation set. Currently, such comparisons ignore estimator variance. By incorporating variance formulas from information theory ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=Basharin%20%281959%29%20obtained%20the%20first,ln2%20p%20j%20%E2%88%92%20H2)) ([Variance of entropy for testing time-varying regimes with an application to meme stocks](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1824880/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=1%20Harris%20,123)), evaluations and statistical tests in ML could become more rigorous.

In summary, entropy estimation has proven its worth in many ML applications (uncertainty quantification, feature selection, etc.), but there remain promising avenues where it is underutilized. Bridging information-theoretic measures with deep learning – especially accounting for the *quality* (variance, bias) of those measures – could improve the **statistical robustness and interpretability** of AI models. As models continue to be deployed in uncertain, data-limited environments, revisiting classical entropy estimation results and integrating them with modern techniques will be a fruitful area of future research ([Calibrated Diverse Ensemble Entropy Minimization for Robust Test-Time Adaptation in Prostate Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12697v1#:~:text=the%20most%20common%20and%20promising,24)) ([A Functional Information Perspective on Model Interpretation](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/gat22a.html#:~:text=Contemporary%20predictive%20models%20are%20hard,our%20method%20surpasses%20existing%20interpretability)).
