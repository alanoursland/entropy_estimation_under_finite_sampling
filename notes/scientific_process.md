# Scientific Process for Robust Entropy Estimation and Model Comparison

This document outlines the scientific process we will follow to develop a robust and principled framework for estimating and comparing the entropy of probabilistic models using finite sample data, particularly in high-dimensional settings.

## 1. Overarching Goal

Develop a system for accurately estimating and fairly comparing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between a data distribution, P(x), and a reference distribution, Q(x), using histogram-based entropy estimation, particularly after applying dimensionality reduction via PCA and whitening.  This involves creating methods for adaptive binning, bias correction, and variance reduction, along with a rigorous theoretical and empirical evaluation of these methods.

## 2. Desiderata (Ideal Solution Properties)

Our ideal solution should possess the following properties:

*   **Accuracy:** Minimize bias and variance in entropy (and therefore KLD) estimation.
*   **Comparability:** Allow for fair comparisons between models with different sample sizes and bin counts.
*   **Computational Feasibility:** Be practical to implement and run within reasonable time constraints.
*   **Interpretability:** The method and its results should be understandable and explainable.
*   **Robustness:** Be relatively insensitive to outliers, noise, and deviations from underlying assumptions.
*   **Generality:** Be applicable to a wide range of data distributions and reference distributions (not limited to Gaussian).

## 3. General Strategies (High-Level Principles)

We will explore the following general strategies:

*   **Adaptive Binning:** Dynamically choose the number and placement of histogram bins based on the data, rather than using fixed rules. This aims to balance resolution and statistical stability.
*   **Bias Correction:** Apply analytical or resampling-based corrections to mitigate the systematic underestimation of entropy that occurs with finite samples.
*   **Variance Estimation and Reduction:** Quantify the uncertainty in entropy estimates and employ techniques to minimize this uncertainty.
*   **Normalization for Fair Comparison:** Develop methods to compare entropy estimates across models with different sample sizes and bin configurations.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA and Whitening):** Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and whitening to standardize the principal components, simplifying the estimation process and making it more robust to high dimensionality.
*   **Percentile-Based Binning (with respect to Q(x))**: Define the histogram bins using percentiles of the *reference distribution* Q(x).  This simplifies the KLD calculation to an entropy calculation.

## 4. Assumptions

We make the following initial assumptions:

*   **Continuous Data:** The underlying data distributions are continuous, although we will be discretizing them using histograms.
*   **Smooth Distributions:** The underlying probability density functions are relatively smooth (no sharp discontinuities). This assumption is important for the validity of histogram-based estimation.
*   **Independent Samples:** The data samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from the underlying distribution.
*  **Computable Reference Distribution:** We can calculate the cumulative density function (CDF) and its inverse (the quantile function) for our chosen reference distribution, Q(x).

These assumptions may be relaxed or revisited later in the process.

## 5. Specific Strategies (Implementation Details)

For each general strategy, we will develop and evaluate specific implementations.  Here are some initial candidates, drawing from the provided documents:

*   **Adaptive Binning:**
    *   **Bayesian Blocks:** A nonparametric, data-driven method that optimizes bin placement based on a likelihood function.
    *   **Occupancy-Based Selection:**  Set the number of bins to ensure a minimum average number of samples per bin.
    *   **Cross-Validation:** Split the data and choose the number of bins that minimizes variance across splits.
    *   **Rice Rule:**  `M_k = 2 * sqrt(N_k)` (Baseline for comparison)
    *   **Freedman-Diaconis Rule:** `M_k = (max(x) - min(x)) / (2 * IQR / N_k^(1/3))` (Baseline for comparison)

*   **Bias Correction:**
    *   **Expected Occupancy Correction:** `H_k^* = H_k + (M_k - S_k) / N_k`
    *   **Jackknife Bias Correction:** `H_k^* = H_k + 1 / (2 * N_k)`
    *   **Chao-Shen Correction:** Uses a smoothed probability estimate based on a Bayesian prior.
    *   **Bootstrap-Based Correction:** Uses resampling to estimate and correct for bias.

*   **Variance Estimation:**
    *   **Analytical Approximation:** `σ_(H,k)^2 ≈ (1/N_k) * (sum(p_(i,k) * (log(p_(i,k)))^2) - H_k^2)` (and its central limit theorem variant).
    *   **Bootstrap Resampling:**  Estimate variance directly from resampled datasets.

* **Normalization for Model Comparison**
    * Corrected Entropy: \(
H_k^* = H_k + \frac{M_k - S_k}{N_k} + \lambda \cdot \sigma_{H,k},
\)
    * Effective Sample Size: \(
N_{\text{eff},k} = S_k \times \frac{N_k}{M_k}.
\)

*   **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    *   **PCA:** Standard Principal Component Analysis.
    *   **Whitening:** Standard whitening transformation after PCA.

For *each* specific strategy, we will:

1.  **Define Inputs, Outputs, and Parameters.**
2.  **Determine Computational Complexity (Big O notation).**

## 6. Mathematical Analysis (Theoretical Justification)

We will rigorously analyze the specific strategies, aiming to:

*   **Derive expressions for bias and variance.**
*   **Prove consistency (if possible).**
*   **Identify conditions for optimality (if possible).**
*   **Relate the strategies to the theoretical bounds derived in Document 6.**
*   **Explicitly state any limitations or approximations in the analysis.**

## 7. Empirical Experiments (Falsification Attempts)

We will design experiments to *attempt to disprove* our strategies. This is crucial for identifying weaknesses and building robust solutions.  Experiments will include:

*   **Varying Sample Size (`N_k`):** Test a wide range of sample sizes, from very small to very large.
*   **Varying Number of Bins (`M_k`):**  Explore a wide range of bin counts, including values that are likely to be suboptimal.
*   **Different Data Distributions (`P(x)`):**
    *   Gaussian distributions (as a baseline).
    *   Uniform distributions.
    *   Skewed distributions (e.g., exponential, log-normal).
    *   Multimodal distributions.
    *   Distributions with heavy tails.
*   **Different Reference Distributions (`Q(x)`):**
    *    Uniform
    *    Gaussian
    *    (Potentially others)
*   **Outliers:** Introduce artificial outliers into the data.
*   **High Dimensionality:** Systematically increase the dimensionality of the data (before PCA).
*   **Non-Independent Components:** Generate data where the principal components are *not* independent.

For *each* experiment, we will:

1.  **State a clear hypothesis.**
2.  **Define metrics to measure performance (bias, variance, KLD, computational time).**
3.  **Establish failure criteria:** What results would lead us to reject or modify a strategy?

## 8. Prior Art

We will review and analyze existing methods, such as the Rice Rule and Freedman-Diaconis Rule, within our theoretical framework.  We will:

*   **Understand the assumptions and derivations of these methods.**
*   **Evaluate their performance empirically using our experiments.**
*   **Compare them to our proposed strategies.**

## 9. Iteration

This is an iterative process. The results of the experiments and theoretical analysis will inform refinements to the strategies, leading to a cycle of:

1.  **Hypothesis Formulation**
2.  **Strategy Development**
3.  **Mathematical Analysis**
4.  **Empirical Testing**
5.  **Refinement/Rejection of Strategies**

This document serves as a living document that will be updated as we progress through the project.
