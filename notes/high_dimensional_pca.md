# High-Dimensional Data and PCA for Entropy Estimation

## 1. Introduction
Entropy estimation in high-dimensional spaces is challenging due to the **curse of dimensionality** and data sparsity. To mitigate these issues, we use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space before estimating entropy. This document outlines the motivation, process, and implications of using PCA and whitening for entropy estimation.

## 2. Motivation for PCA in Entropy Estimation
- High-dimensional histograms become **exponentially sparse**, making entropy estimates unreliable.
- **PCA extracts principal components**, reducing dimensionality while preserving variance.
- By **whitening the data**, we can compare entropy estimates consistently across different datasets.

## 3. PCA and Whitening Process
Given a dataset with samples \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \):
1. **Compute Mean and Covariance**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i, \quad \Sigma = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_i - \mu)(X_i - \mu)^T.
   \]
2. **Perform Eigenvalue Decomposition**:
   \[
   \Sigma = V \Lambda V^T,
   \]
   where \( V \) contains eigenvectors and \( \Lambda \) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
3. **Project Data onto Principal Components**:
   \[
   Z = V^T (X - \mu).
   \]
   This transforms the data into a rotated coordinate system aligned with principal components.
4. **Whiten the Data**:
   \[
   W = \Lambda^{-1/2} V^T (X - \mu).
   \]
   Whitening ensures the transformed data follows an approximately isotropic distribution.

## 4. Entropy Estimation in the PCA Space
Once the data is transformed into whitened principal components:
- The distribution should approximate **\( N(0,1) \)**, allowing straightforward entropy estimation.
- Histogram binning is performed in the transformed space.
- Entropy comparisons become **scale-invariant** since whitening normalizes variance.

## 5. Implications for Kullback-Leibler Divergence Estimation
- The reference distribution \( Q(x) \) is taken as **\( N(0,1) \)** in the transformed space.
- Entropy estimation in this space provides a direct measure of **how much the data deviates from Gaussianity**.
- This enables consistent KLD estimation between the data distribution and \( N(0,1) \).

## 6. Conclusion
Using PCA and whitening before entropy estimation improves stability, enables fair comparisons across datasets, and aligns with theoretical assumptions in KLD estimation. This transformation ensures that entropy estimates remain meaningful even in high-dimensional settings.
